title: Content Block -- Media
---

**A media content block is the traditional image-on-the-left, content-on-the-right content block that was made famous in OOCSS.**
This version differs in two ways:
- its done in CSS grid.
- it includes an optional footer area.

#Design Notes:#
- The "media" area is set to a max width, while the content area fills in whatever is left over.
- The footer section is optional. If there is no content, it will not appear.
