title: Breadcrumb List

**Shows the user's path back to the root of the site.**

Design notes on Breadcrumbs:

- Transitions last 200ms and are between all properties.
- The last item in the list is not a link
- The markup uses Google's microdata format - but not it's markup. [Google developer Guides](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumbs)
- Icons between breadcrumb items should be one step smaller than the font size of the breadcrumb items.
- Icons should be hidden from screen readers.
